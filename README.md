# VIVA - Virtual Intelligent Voice Assistant

VIVA is a virtual voice assistant that can be used to carry out simple tasks, like placing orders or scheduling appointments. This project provides the tools and resources you need to build your own virtual assistant using advanced natural language processing techniques.

## Features

- Easy-to-use voice interface
- Customizable commands and responses

In the future, the integration with popular APIs and services within this project will provide users with a 
wide range of capabilities, from setting reminders to placing orders, making their daily lives more convenient and
productive. Additionally, the built-in machine learning algorithms for natural language processing will enhance 
the voice assistant's ability to interpret and respond to user commands, 
improving its accuracy and effectiveness over time.

## Getting Started
To get started with VIVA, you'll need to have some knowledge of programming and natural language processing. 

## Installation

To install VIVA, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/timoterik/viva.git
- Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the main.py file to start the virtual assistant: python main.py

## Usage
To use VIVA, simply speak into your computer's microphone and ask it to carry out a task. VIVA will use natural 
language processing techniques to understand your command and execute the appropriate action.
You can customize the commands and responses in the config.py file. This file contains a dictionary of command phrases 
and their corresponding actions. You can add your own commands and responses to the dictionary to customize VIVA's behavior.
